# Relative role of border restrictions, case finding and contact tracing in controlling SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of undetected transmission

This repository contains code and aggregate data to reconstruct the COVID-19 pandemic trajectory in Singapore. For each time period of the pandemic, we simulated the transmissions through a branching process model to compute the expected incidence over time and model outputs were fitted against the daily incidence of linked and unlinked local COVID-19 cases. Model parameters were estimated using a Bayesian MCMC framework.
